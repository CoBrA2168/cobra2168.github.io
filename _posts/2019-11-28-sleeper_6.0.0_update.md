With the recent release of [checkra1n](https://checkra.in), we now have a feasible jailbreak solution for iOS 13 devices.  Luckily, I have a spare device (iPhone SE) that can run iOS 13 and is checkra1n compatible.  This enabled me to immediately start working on the iOS 13 update.

This new jailbreak release came at a time when I was readying a v5.5.0 update of Sleeper, which would have contained all of the other holiday skip improvements I've been working on for a few months now.  I decided to wrap up those changes together with the iOS 13 / checkra1n support and bump the version straight to v6.0.0.  So here we are now with the release!
