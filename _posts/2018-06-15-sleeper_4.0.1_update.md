I've submitted a small bugfix release to the BigBoss repository for Sleeper.  This is a minor bugfix that addresses an issue where the skip alert would not prompt the user to skip a recurring alarm in some particular instances.  This wasn't a reported issue, but something I found from usage (I've been getting up earlier for some reason, allowing me to use the skip feature more often üòÅ).  This issue has likely existed for a few years, so I'm surprised no one has reported it yet.

A reminder for users on iOS 11: purchases are still not enabled on the Cydia Store for iOS 11.  Luckily, someone has created a tweak that allows users to purchase tweaks via the Cydia Store.  Installing the tweak "MakeCydiaBuyAgain" will allow users on iOS 11 to buy Sleeper.  You can grab that .deb file [here.](https://github.com/JakeAi/JakeAi.github.io/tree/master/debs)  If you're still having issues or can't get it working, contact me directly and I'll do my best to help get Sleeper on your device.
