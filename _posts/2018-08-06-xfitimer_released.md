After over 3 years of development of what started as a hobby project, I've finally managed to get my HIIT timer application into a releasable state.  xFiTimer v1.0.0 is available now for FREE [on the App Store.](https://joshuaseltzer.github.io/time2wod/)  It supports all iOS devices (including both iPhones and iPads) on iOS 9 or later.  If you enjoy the application and wish to help support future development, consider purchasing xFiTimer Rx (available as an in-app purchase) for the full experience.

More details can be found on the App Store.  If you have any questions, problems, or concerns please use one of the methods on the left to contact me.
