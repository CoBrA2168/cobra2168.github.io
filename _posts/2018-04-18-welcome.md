I'm Joshua Seltzer, an iOS Software Developer and tech enthusiast.  I also dabble with Java, Python, and various other languages that I find interesting.  I plan to use this space to talk about different projects I'm working on, as well as post any updates to some of my existing projects.  My current projects are listed in the navigation pane at the top of this space.  You might also find some other code snippets over on my Github repository, linked to the left.

Outside of coding, I have fun playing with different technology, snowboarding, biking, and exercising.  I spend most of my time with my sidekick and fianc√©, Courteney.

If you would like to reach out, feel free to use one of the methods linked in my profile to the left.  Thanks for visiting!
