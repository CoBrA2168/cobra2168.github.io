Since the Cydia Store (i.e. BigBoss) is no longer processing payments for tweaks, it has been decided to move Sleeper to another repository.  New users of Sleeper should add the [Packix Repository](https://repo.packix.com/) to the sources list from within Cydia/Sileo in order to see the tweak.  Once the repository has been added, you can [purchase Sleeper here.](https://joshuaseltzer.github.io/sleeper/)

If you're an existing user of Sleeper, you can continue to use the [BigBoss version](https://joshuaseltzer.github.io/sleeper_legacy/) as it will continue receiving updates as long as BigBoss is still hosting packages and accepting new versions.  If you wish to switch over to the Packix version, you should receive the tweak for free as long as you've purchased it through the Cydia Store in the past.  Regardless of which repository you download Sleeper from, you'll be receiving the same exact product.  The BigBoss version of Sleeper has been renamed to "Sleeper (Legacy)" to distinguish that it is the outgoing version but that does not mean it is in anyway worse or behind in features from Sleeper hosted on Packix.
